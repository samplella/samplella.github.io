Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

*Question 2*:   
  
From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

Hello Carrie, 

Thank you for reaching out. 

I would like to help you further with your issue. 

If I understand correctly users are uploading records with a lot of data that is not necessary for the search. 

I would advice if it's possible to remove that extra metadata. One of the reasons of limitation is having very big chunks of text that is not really used which will match with a lot of irrelevant queries.

Let me know if it's possible to apply this solution and it works correctly on your side.

Best regards,

Hello Marc,

Thank you for your email. 

Based on your image I can see that a library might be missing. Can you please review you have it installed?

Here is the documentation about that library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/searchkit

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
